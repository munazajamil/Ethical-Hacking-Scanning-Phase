🔍 Scanning Phase - Ethical Hacking Practice (Kali Linux)

Overview 📌
This project documents my practical work in the "Scanning Phase" of penetration testing.  
The scanning phase comes after reconnaissance and involves identifying live hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.

Objectives 🎯 
- Understand active vs passive scanning
- Perform different types of scans:
  - Port scanning
  - Network scanning
  - Vulnerability scanning
- Interpret results for further penetration testing

 Tools Used  🛠
- "Nmap" – Port & service detection
- "Netdiscover" – Live host discovery
- "Nikto" – Basic vulnerability scanning
- "Zaproxy" – Web server vulnerability scanning

 Practical Demonstration 🧪 
For each tool, you can find:
- Commands i used
- Purpose of the scan
- Screenshot of the output
- Summary of results
